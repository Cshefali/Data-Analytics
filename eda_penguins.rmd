## About the data:
* The Palmer Penguins dataset is pre-loaded in Rstudio.This dataset was    prepared by Dr. Kristen Gormon.  
* Our penguins belong to 3 islands- _Dream_, _Biscoe_, _Torgersen_.
* They belong to 3 species- _Gentoo_, _Chinstrip_, _Adelie_.
* Data has been collected for 3 years- 2007, 2008 and 2009.
* It contains the body measurements of these penguins: *flipper length (in mm)*,
*body mass (in grams)*, *bill length (in mm)*, *bill depth (in mm)*.

## Why did I analyse this data?
Just for practice!

## Environment Setup
Setting up my environment by loading all relevant packages- `tidyverse`,`ggplot2` (for visualization) & `palmerpenguins` dataset.

```{r loading packages, include=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
```

The dataset contains some missing values which will be omitted before usage. 
```{r loading data, include=FALSE}
penguins_data <- data.frame(penguins)

#na.omit() removes all the rows with missing data.
clean_penguins_data <- na.omit(penguins_data)
```

A basic theme that will be applied to all the plots has been stored in a variable. All other components of theme layout specific to a particular plot will be added as another layer on this basic layer. 

```{r theme template, include=FALSE}
#Basic theme for plot are and labels has been stored in plot_theme and labels_theme.
#These themes will apply to all the plots; hence stored in a variable as a template.

plot_theme <- theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
                        panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA, size = 1),
                        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
                        axis.title.y = element_blank())

labels_theme <- theme(text = element_text(size = 10, family = "mono",
                         face = "bold"), plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
                         plot.caption = element_text(face = "italic"))

#This caption will be included in every plot.
caption_line <- "Data collected by Dr. Kristen Gormon from 2007-2009"
```

### 1. From 2007 to 2009, which penguin species accounted for highest population in the 3 islands?  
```{r penguin population, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = clean_penguins_data,aes(x = species, fill =species)) + 
  geom_bar(width = 0.4) +
  geom_text(aes(label=..count..), vjust = 1.5,stat = "count", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Count of Each Species in 3 Years", caption = caption_line, y = "Count of each species") +
  plot_theme +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labels_theme

```

_**Adelie**_ species of penguins account for highest population on all 3 islands combined, followed by _**Gentoo**_ and then _**Chinstrap**_. 

### 2. Do penguin species co-habitate?  Which species accounts for highest population on each island?
```{r penguin per island, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = clean_penguins_data,aes(x = species, fill = species)) + 
  geom_bar() +
  geom_text(aes(label = ..count..),vjust = 1.5,stat = "count",color = "black")+
  labs(title = "Count of Each Species per Island", caption = caption_line) +
  facet_wrap(~island) + plot_theme +  labels_theme +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),legend.position = "none")
```

Yes! 

* **Biscoe Island**- Both _Adelie_ and _Gentoo_ species found on this island.
* **Dream**- _Adelie_ and _Chinstrap_ penguins are found on this island.
* **Torgersen**- Sadly, only **Adelie** penguins live on this island. :(

### 3. Population of male and female penguins per year.
```{r male female population, echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = clean_penguins_data,aes(x = species, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "Population of Male and Female Penguins per Year", caption=caption_line, x="penguin species", y="total count")+
  plot_theme + labels_theme +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))+
  facet_wrap(~year)
```

Well, the gender ratio seems balanced among these folks (in this data, of course. :|)  

### 4. Do penguins with higher body mass have longer flippers?
```{r flip length body mass, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data=clean_penguins_data, aes(x=body_mass_g, y=flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(color = species))+
  geom_smooth(color = "black")+
  labs(title="Body mass vs. flipper length", caption = caption_line, 
       x = "body mass(in grams)", y = "flipper length(in mm)") +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA, size = 1)) + 
  labels_theme
```


More the body mass, longer are the flippers with _**Gentoo**_ penguins being the heaviest and with longest flippers. _**Adelie**_ penguins are the lightest of them all with smallest flippers. They must be cute!  

##### Penguins_stats is a dataframe created to store the average body measurements of each penguin species.
```{r penguin_stats}
penguins_stats <- clean_penguins_data %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  summarize(avg_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm,2), avg_bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm,2),
            avg_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm,2), avg_body_mass = mean(body_mass_g,2))
```
##### The stats are as follows:  
```{r head_penguin_stats}
head(penguins_stats)
```

### Average bill length of each species.
```{r average_bill_length}
ggplot(data = penguins_stats,aes(x=species, y=avg_bill_length, fill=species)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",width=0.3)+
  geom_text(aes(label=avg_bill_length), vjust = 1.5,stat = "identity", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Average Bill Length(mm) of Each Species",caption = caption_line,
       y = "average bill length(mm)")+
  plot_theme + labels_theme +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

_**Chinstrap**_ penguins have the longest beak on an average, followed by _**Gentoo**_ and then _**Adelie**_. 

### Average bill depth of each species.
```{r average_bill_depth}
ggplot(data = penguins_stats, aes(x=species,y=avg_bill_depth,fill=species))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",width = 0.3)+
  geom_text(aes(label=avg_bill_depth), vjust = 1.5,stat = "identity", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Average Bill Depth(mm) of Each Species", caption = caption_line,
       y = "average bill depth(mm)")+
  plot_theme + labels_theme +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

So, _**Gentoo**_ penguins have the deepest beaks. And the other 2 size almost equal in terms of bill depth.  

### Average flipper length of each species
```{r average_flipper_length}
ggplot(data=penguins_stats, aes(x=species,y=avg_flipper_length,fill=species))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",width = 0.3)+
  geom_text(aes(label=avg_flipper_length), vjust = 1.5,stat = "identity", color = "black")+
  labs(title="Average Flipper Length(mm) of Each Species",caption = caption_line,
       y = "average flipper length(mm)")+
  plot_theme + labels_theme +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

As seen in the scatter plot above and even this chart, _**Gentoo's**_ have the longest beaks.  

### Average body mass of each species
```{r average_body_mass}
ggplot(data = penguins_stats, aes(x=species,y=avg_body_mass,fill=species))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",width = 0.3)+
  geom_text(aes(label=avg_body_mass), vjust = 1.5,stat = "identity", color = "black")+
  labs(title = "Average Body Mass(grams) of Each Species",caption=caption_line,
       y = "average body mass(grams)")+
  plot_theme + labels_theme +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

From the above charts, we can summarize the following: 

* **Adelie** penguins are the smallest- they are light, have short flippers and shortest beaks.
* **Gentoo** penguins are the heaviest- they have the highest body mass, longest flippers, longest beaks and their beaks have higher depth compared to the other two.  

##### gender_count stores the male and female population of each species per island.
```{r gender_count_wide_frame, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gender_count <- clean_penguins_data %>% 
  group_by(species,island) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  summarize(male = sum(sex == 'male'), female = sum(sex=='female'))
```
##### A quick peak into the wide-form of gender_count aggregation.  
```{r head_gender_count, echo=FALSE}
head(gender_count)
```
##### gender_count_long_form is just the same aggregation as earlier, converted to long format.
```{r gender_count_long_form}
gender_count_long_form <- pivot_longer(gender_count, cols = c(male,female),names_to = "gender",values_to = "total_count")
```
#### A quick peak into the long-form of the same data.
```{r head_gender_count_long_form}
head(gender_count_long_form)
```
The gender_count data was converted from wide format to long format in order to plot male and female population of each species side by side and not as a stacked bar chart.  

### Plotting male and female count of each species separately.
```{r male_female_count_per_species}
ggplot(data = gender_count_long_form, aes(x=species,y=total_count,fill=gender))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",width = 0.4,position = "dodge")+
  labs(title="Male and Female Penguin Population per Species",caption = caption_line, x="penguin species", y="total count")+
  plot_theme + labels_theme
```

The male to female ration is pretty much balanced among the 3 species of penguins here.  

### Plotting male and female population per species per island.
```{r male_female_count_per_island_per_species}
ggplot(data = gender_count_long_form, aes(x=species,y=total_count,fill=gender))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",width = 0.4,position = "dodge")+
  labs(title="Male and Female Penguin Population per Species",caption = caption_line, x="penguin species", y="total count")+
  plot_theme + labels_theme + facet_wrap(~island) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))
```

Lastly, this is the viz for male to female population of each species on each island.

#### Here is the summary of the analysis:

* **Torgersen** is the only island here with just 1 species population, i.e. *Adelie*.
* **Gentoo** penguins are only found on *Biscoe* island.
* **Gentoos** are the plump ones- the heaviest and largest, with longest beaks and flippers. 
* **Adelie** are the smallest and lightest with smallest beaks and flippers.
* **Chinstrap** penguins have the longest beaks on average.
* The male to female population on each island seems pretty much balanced.

###### THE END (for now :))
